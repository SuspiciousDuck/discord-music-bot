# My music bot for Discord
This is a passion project that I've made because most popular music bots don't support playing through link. This bot contains a handful of features that I find useful which include but are not limited to: <br />
*Link playability <br />
*Youtube search <br />
*Playlist support <br />
*And more! <br />
You are free to use this code however you please and tinkering with the code is encouraged. Have fun with your music!

Now, you're all set!
